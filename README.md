# Resume-RAG-Classifier
This is a simple Python-based tool that assists job applicants in selecting the most appropriate version of their resume—**Business** or **Technical**—based on the content of a job description. By analyzing the semantic similarity between the job description and each resume type, the program recommends the better-fitting resume for submission.
